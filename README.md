# ElasticStar

This is a project I created to better visualise my bank transaction data using the Elastic Stack. Take a look at the "Documentation" folder for a deeper dive into the project or the "images" folder to see the results for yourself.

There's a detailed Project Report in the "Documentation" folder along with a writeup for my AirBnb transactions dashboard. I'm hoping to add a bit more to that folder in the coming months so keep an eye out. The "Issues" tab has a list of tasks left for me to do before I can call this project a wrap.

## Make your own

I wanted to have this be a website where you could press a button and make your own deployment. However, access to any kind of banking data is heavily regulated (for good reason) and going through that process would be a lot for this small application. You can still make your own version of this, but it isn't as simple as clicking a button. I've written a ([forking-instructions.md](/Documentation/forking-instructions.md)) guide which will help you through the process. If you have any issues with it please raise an issue, and I'll take a look.
