# ElasticStar

This is a project I created to better visualise my bank transaction data using the Elastic Stack. Take a look at the "Documentation" folder for a deeper dive into the project or the "images" folder to see the results for yourself.

There's a detailed Project Report in the "Documentation" folder along with a writeup for my AirBnb transactions dashboard. I'm hoping to add a bit more to that folder in the coming months so keep an eye out. The "Issues" tab has a list of tasks left for me to do before I can call this project a wrap.
