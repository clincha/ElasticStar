# ElasticStar

This is a project I created to better visualise my bank transaction data using the Elastic Stack. Take a look at the "Documentation" folder for a deeper look or the "images" folder to see the results. There's a detailed Project Report in the "Documentation" folder along with a writeup for my AirBnb transactions dashboard.
